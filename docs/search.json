Remember: you spend your time here not just to get grade, but to learn and make this knowledge your own. Here’s my advice:\n\nLearn how to ask: LLMs are most helpful when you know what to ask it and how to interpret its result, NOT when you copy+paste questions and then copy+paste the answer it provides.\nGet definition: If you’re asking questions about OS definitions or explanations about terminology, that’s great! LLM can be a great Google replacement.\nFor programming lab assignments, try to write your code independently first. If you get stuck, it’s okay to ask an LLM for guidance on function usage or debugging help, but make sure you understand the solution. Never submit code that you don’t thoroughly understand.\nIf you’re brainstorming approaches to a problem, always think on your own first and then ask an LLM to expand your ideas. You don’t want to limit your thinking by relying on AI first.

Remember: you spend your time here not just to get grade, but to learn and make this knowledge your own. Here’s my advice:\n\nLearn how to ask: LLMs are most helpful when you know what to ask it and how to interpret its result, NOT when you copy+paste questions and then copy+paste the answer it provides.\nGet definition: If you’re asking questions about OS definitions or explanations about terminology, that’s great! LLM can be a great Google replacement.\nFor programming lab assignments, try to write your code independently first. If you get stuck, it’s okay to ask an LLM for guidance on function usage or debugging help, but make sure you understand the solution.
