Each team will pick a topic. By the end of the semester, each team will make a short video (3-5 minutes) to share with your classmates. The goal is not to repeat what we’ve already taught, but to dig deeper into the “why” behind the topics, and connect them to real-world problems.\nThis project is your chance to ask your own questions, explain concepts in your own words, and make sense of complex ideas through your own exploration.\n\n\nWe will annouce a list of topics and papers for you to choose from before midterm. But you are also welcome to propose your own ideas if you have something you’re curious about. Your project can take one of these directions:\n\n\n\nPick a topic, research it very thoroughly, and produce a short video that teaches this topic to your classmates. Please make it very fun and educational to watch. You can also teach about common misconceptions, or parts that confused you at first, and helps your audience go through it.\n\n\n\nWe will give you a list of research papers on OS topics.

Typically, OS has to be rebooted after a security update. This could be problematic in many situations. There are many systems that must run non-stop for years. For example, a nuclear plant can’t be shut down to apply OS security update to its software. Don’t be surprised if nuclear plant still run IBM mainframe from the 1980s.\n\n2024 CrowdStrike Nightmare\n8.5 million systems running Windows crash into blue screen on July 19, 2024 due to a security update.\nGlobal damage: 5078 air flights, 4.6% of those scheduled that day, were cancelled.\nWikipedia: \n\nOn 19 July at 04:09 UTC, CrowdStrike distributed a faulty configuration update for its Falcon sensor software running on Windows PCs and servers. A modification to a configuration file which was responsible for screening named pipes, Channel File 291, caused an out-of-bounds memory read in the Windows sensor client that resulted in an invalid page fault. The update caused machines to either enter into a bootloop or boot into recovery mode.\nAlmost immediately, Windows virtual machines on the Microsoft Azure cloud platform began rebooting and crashing, and at 06:48 UTC, Google Compute Engine also reported the problem.\n\nHow to fix?\n\nAffected machines could be restored by rebooting while connected to the network; ideally while connected to Ethernet, thus providing the opportunity to download the reverted channel file, with multiple reboots reportedly required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecurity v.s Availability\n\n\n\n\n\nAvailability measures how long a service remains functional. Availability is important for e-commerce platforms like PChome, which lose a lot of money if customers cannot access the website even for a few minutes. Major websites strive to keep their downtime within minutes per year (downtime status statistics)\nMany companies accept delayed security updates to avoid risks like unexpected service disruptions. However, this trade-off can be dangerous. In 2017, the WannaCry attack caused chaos globally. In 2018, TSMC was attacked by WannaCry and lost billions of NTD. TSMC was attacked because it had not applied the security patches Microsoft released after the initial outbreak in 2017.\n\n\n\nOn Linux, we use “kernel panic” to refer to an OS crash.

But a server might take 10 minutes to boot, and that’s perfectly fine.\n\nUptime: You probably reboot your laptop every few days for an update. When I was a student admin for the NTU CS workstations, we had servers that ran continuously for months without stopping. There can be hundreds of students compiling code, and some would inevitably write programs that tried to eat all the memory. We couldn’t just reboot the machine. The OS must control the damage from a single user without affecting anyone else. You don’t need that on your PC.\n\nScale: Your laptop might have 8~16 CPU cores. A big server in Google’s data center can have over 200 cores and 2 Terabytes of RAM. Its CPUs even run at a slower clock speed than your laptop’s! Why? Because its OS is optimized for throughput (handling thousands of Google Colab users at once), not latency (making one user’s mouse feel quick).\nPower: How does a Huawei GT Pro smartwatch last for two weeks without charging, while an Apple Watch lasts no more than one day? It has a lot to do with the OS.\n\nThe amazing thing is that the same Linux kernel can be configured to run in all these different scenarios.

This worksheet includes required videos, textbook readings, and a hands-on lab. Please work through this material independently, and discuss any problems you encounter with your teammates (three people per team).\n\nAs you work, collaborate on a shared HackMD document for your team’s learning notes. The hands-on lab contains several reflection questions (marked Q1, Q2, etc.). Write your answers in the HackMD document.\nWe also encourage you to explore beyond the required content by asking your own questions and documenting your discoveries.

You may continue to add content to your HackMD after the deadline, but any changes made after the submission time may not be reviewed by the TAs.\nNote: Teams that do not submit their link on time will be ineligible for that week’s shio selection.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your notes or shio explorations are selected by TA, we will award your team a shio card. The instructor might highlight the shio during lecture, if time allowed.\nAt the end of the semester, we will rank teams by the number of shio card they get throughout the semester. The top 6 team will receive +6 extra points to their final course grade. The 7th to 12th team will receive +4 extra points to their final course grade.
